Mentoring SuperHighway is a free guide to all things high school and transitioning to college. This guide will cover the transition from middle school to high school, from course selections, extracurriculars, advice from current and past students, tips from college admission counselors, and more. This guide is geared specifically for 7th grade and above to teach them about how important it is to think about post graduate plans from a young age. This guide (in parts or as a whole) may be only be applicable for students in the United States of America.

Once per month there will be a zoom call which will have a special guest whether that be a current high school student, past high school student, high school counselor, or college admissions officer. These zoom calls will be accessible through our mailing list which can be signed up for in the “Join” tab of our website.

If there are any questions with this program or any concerns please reach out to us in the "Contact Us" tab. Be sure to put your full name, email, and comments or questions you have.

Please follow our social media linked in the website's footer.
