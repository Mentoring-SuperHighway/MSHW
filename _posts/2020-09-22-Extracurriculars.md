Colleges like students to develop passions and pursue them with determination. This applies to extracurriculars and school work. Students should try different interests on for size; itâ€™s both fun and valuable during this time of exploration.

 

Middle school is also a good time to think about how students will build on interests during high school. Choosing one or two activities and developing them over time shows determination and mastery. Consider which ones to emphasize and continue throughout high school.

 

The bridge to high school from middle school can feel long and scary. But with parental help, students can develop helpful habits, explore college and career goals in a gentle way and see high school as something to look forward to, not run from.
